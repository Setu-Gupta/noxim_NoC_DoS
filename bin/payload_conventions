Payload type and corresponding identification
0->normal
1->write
2->read
3->read_reply
4->malicious 2 cycle

Descriptions:

0. Normal
	This is a generic packet with no significance.
	Data field is initialized to -1.
	NOTE:	If payload type is not reserved/specified, it is treated as Normal type.
		Type is initialized to 0 or specified value (Value should not be reserved type).

1. Write
	This packet signifies a write from source to destination.
	Data field specifies the data to be written. (32bit signed int type value).
	If Data is not specified, it is initialized to -1.

2. Read
	This packet signifies a read from source to destination.
	Data field is initialized to -1.

3. Read Reply
	This packet signifies a read reply from source to destination.
	Data field specifies the read data. (32bit signed int type value).
	NOTE: This type cannot be specified in Traffic Table. This will raise an error.

4. Malicious 2 Cycle
	This packet signifies an ongoint attack between source and destination.
	Data field specifies the packet count of current packet. It is initialized to 1.
	USAGE:	Send one packet from src to dst using Traffic Table.
		The code will then automatically continue the chain of packets by generating new packets one after another.
